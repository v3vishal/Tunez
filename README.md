# Tunez
A simple music bot made using the discord-player library - https://discord-player.js.org/

It's very simple to run! ADD YOUR BOT TOKEN IN CONFIG.JSON, then just take this code as a zip file and run `npm install`, to run the bot use `node src/index.js`!

WARNING: Some features are still not updated, so you will experience that certain features aren't working. Kindly wait till we update it to v6.6.4 completely. 
Till then, our public bot is still live with this code. Link - CURRENTLY DISABLED
